"""Shared staged story planning for MiniMax H3 timelines.

Both FL2VA sliding windows and Ref2VA editorial sequences need the same story
discipline: a requested event must happen once, quoted dialogue must remain
verbatim, and every segment must advance from a concrete state.  Asking a
small local LLM to write every finished H3 prompt in one response made those
contracts fragile and could hit the response-token ceiling.  This module keeps
the first response compact, then expands and validates one segment at a time.
