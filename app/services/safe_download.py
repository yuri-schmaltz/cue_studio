"""
Stall-resilient download configuration + UI hook.

Problem this solves
-------------------
Fresh-install users hit a brutal first impression when HuggingFace
CDN drops a connection mid-download. The TCP socket stays alive but
no bytes flow, and the default `huggingface_hub` library doesn't
notice — the download client sits indefinitely on a stalled read
while the user watches a frozen progress bar in console.

Two-layer fix:

1. Set HF_HUB_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT (newer hf-hub versions read this).
2. Monkey-patch the requests library to inject a default read
   timeout on every HTTP call. The read timeout fires when no
   bytes flow for N seconds; `requests.iter_content` raises
   `requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout` which `huggingface_hub`'s
   retry layer catches and resumes from the partial file.

Together these make stalled connections self-heal in ~30s instead
of waiting forever. The 30s threshold is conservative — even slow
internet delivers SOME bytes every few seconds; 30s of silence is
unambiguous "TCP died but didn't tell us."

UI hook
-------
Active downloads are tracked in a module-level dict so the API
layer can surface the state to the UI:

  {
      "<file_id>": {
          "filename": str,            # display name
          "started_at": float,        # epoch
          "last_active_at": float,    # epoch (for stall detection)
          "downloaded_bytes": int,
          "total_bytes": int | None,
          "status": "downloading" | "stalled" | "retrying" | "done",
      },
      ...
  }

The tracking is best-effort — it depends on `tqdm`-monkey-patching
the progress bars HuggingFace Hub uses. If a code path bypasses
tqdm, the dict may be empty even during active downloads. Stalls
are still recovered automatically by the timeout layer regardless.

Import this module BEFORE huggingface_hub or any module that uses
requests for downloads. Effects apply globally on import.
