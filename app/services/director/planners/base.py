        Returns parsed list of dicts (shot plan objects).

        json_schema (optional) grammar-constrains the output on local
        llama-server so the model physically cannot emit malformed JSON
        or repeat-loop garbage. Applied on the FIRST attempt only when
        that model's thinking is off (grammar and thinking are mutually
        exclusive — see llm_service.generate — and the thinking-on Gemma
        path is a known-good flow we don't disturb). Applied ALWAYS on
        the parse-failure retry (with thinking forced off), falling back
        to a generic array-of-objects grammar when no schema was given,
        so every planner's retry is loop-proof. If the server rejects
        the grammar (old binary, remote provider), each constrained call
        degrades to the exact pre-grammar behavior.

        Repetition penalties (default frequency=0.3, presence=0.1) are
        critical here: planner output is structured JSON across many
        similar fields (subjects_on_screen, action_beats, window_prompts).
        Without penalties the model locks onto a "good" pattern and
        loops, producing window_prompts that repeat the same paragraph
        3-4 times within a single field — observed empirically on Qwen
        3.5/3.6 with the long Pass 2 system prompt. Restored after the
        c1a950c global-removal commit, which broke planning while
        helping creative streaming.

        thinking_budget is now MODEL-AWARE when caller leaves it as None:
          - Qwen3.5/3.6 ("qwen" thinking_style): budget=0, thinking forced
            off. These templates have known runaway behavior on long
            structured tasks — model burns the entire budget on internal
            reasoning before emitting any JSON (10-min hangs in test).
          - Gemma 3/4 ("gemma" thinking_style): budget=4096, thinking ON.
            Gemma's reasoning is well-behaved and helps it follow the
            structured-output rules (e.g. "21s shot needs window_prompts").
            Without thinking, smaller Gemma models like 4B miss these
            rules under cognitive load.
          - Other / unknown: budget=0, thinking off (conservative default).
        Callers can still pass an explicit thinking_budget to override.
